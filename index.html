			Hello & welcome!

		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			I'm currently creating this website as I dive into front-end development.
			As I'm developing this site, I'm exploring its purpose both as a learning tool and a creative outlet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thanks for stopping by and stay tuned for more!

		<h2>
			Web Development
		</h2>
		<p>As I began to take my programming skills to the next level, one of my goals was to be able to communicate
			through code.
			I believe web development can be a great way to do that.
		</p>
		<p>The following is a brief list of my current tools and resources for this project:
		<ul>
			<li>IDE: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a></li>
			<li>Structure: HTML</li>
			<li>Styling: CSS</li>
			<li>Interactivity: JavaScript</li>
			<li>Design: <a href="https://design.google">Google Design</a>
				<ul>
					<li>As I add content and focus on the digital experience, open-source code,
						<a href="https://material.io">Material Design</a>, will definitely be a go-to.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Version Control: <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
		</ul>

		<h2>Data Science</h2>
		<p>Dâ€‹ata scientists and data science can have several meanings depending on who you're talking to.
			I see data science as the study of large quantities of data and data scientists as the curious storytellers
			who connect the dots.
			As I advance my Python skills, I hope to create meaninful solutions and stories along the way.
		</p>
		<p>I recenlty began taking courses to obtain an IBM Data Science professional certification.
			The badges below are a fun way of displaying some the courses I've completed.
